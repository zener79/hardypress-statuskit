We're seeing slow loads of our dashboard (app.hardypress.com) and difficulty in using our web UI. We're looking into it now, but it seems related to an outage an oa major cloud provider. Live sites hosted on HardyPress are unaffected.

**Monitoring**: Weâ€™ve found a cause of the slowdown and mitigated it and continue to monitor. {{< track "2018-06-27T16:18:12.000Z" >}}
