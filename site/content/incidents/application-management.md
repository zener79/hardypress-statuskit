An outage on a major cloud provider is causing downtime on our API. We are working on mitigating the effects. Live sites hosted on HardyPress are unaffected.



**Monitoring**: API and Dashboard are fully operational again. We will continue monitoring to ensure that this issue is fully resolved.. {{< track "2019-05-15T18:56:31.000Z" >}}
